        <p id="carter_bio1" class="bio">Hey! My name is Carter Meadows. I am a software developer from UNC Charlotte.
        My passion for computers started when I was a child and built my first computer. Ever since then, I have messed with the creative side
        of software, such as modding video games and more recently making video games.</p>
        <p id="carter_bio2" class="bio">A recent development project of mine has been a horror style Oregon Trail based video game
        that my friends and I have been creating over the past few months. This has been a low stakes passion project for us and has helped all of
        us grow a lot as developers.</p>
